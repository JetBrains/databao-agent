In this dataset, the \\\"month\\\" column is a date, and there are several quantitative columns such as \\\"revenue\\\", \\\"orders_count\\\", and \\\"average_review_score\\\". A typical default is to plot \\\"revenue\\\" over \\\"month\\\" as a line chart, showing how revenue changes each month. No filters or transformations are needed for this basic chart.', 'relevant_request': None, 'relevant_request_rationale': None, 'data_exists': None, 'data_exists_rationale': None}}, plot=alt.Chart(...), code='{\\\\n  \\\"$schema\\\": \\\"https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json\\\",\\\\n  \\\"mark\\\": \\\"line\\\",\\\\n  \\\"encoding\\\": {\\\\n    \\\"x\\\": {\\\\n      \\\"field\\\": \\\"month\\\",\\\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"temporal\\\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    \\\"y\\\": {\\\\n      \\\"field\\\": \\\"revenue\\\",\\\\n      \\\"type\\\": \\\"quantitative\\\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  }\\\\n}', spec={'$schema': 'https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json', 'mark': 'line', 'encoding': {'x': {'field': 'month', 'type': 'temporal'}, 'y': {'field': 'revenue', 'type': 'quantitative'}}}, spec_df=       month    revenue  revenue_2mo_ma  orders_count  orders_count_2mo_ma  \\\\\\n\",\n",
