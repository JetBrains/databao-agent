      "\n",
      "1. **Monthly Revenue & Orders Count**:  \n",
      "   - Group sales data by month (`order_purchased_at`), summing `item_price` for revenue and counting distinct `order_id` for orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Monthly Average Review Score**:  \n",
      "   - Group reviews by month (`review_sent_at`), averaging `review_score`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **2-Month Moving Averages**:  \n",
      "   - For each metric, calculate the average of the current and previous month.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Combine Results**:  \n",
      "   - Join the three time series on month.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Implementation Details\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use `DATE_TRUNC('month', ...)` to group by month.\n",
      "- Use window functions for moving averages.\n",
      "- Use left joins to ensure all months are included, even if some metrics are missing.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Classify Orders:**\n",
      "   - Single-item order: order with only 1 item.\n",
      "   - Multi-item order: order with more than 1 item.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Compute Metrics for Each Group:**\n",
      "   - `orders_count`: Number of orders in each group.\n",
      "   - `avg_total_freight_per_order`: Average total freight value per order.\n",
      "   - `cancellation_rate`: Percentage of orders with status 'canceled'.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implementation:**\n",
      "   - Use `fct_sales` to count items and sum freight per order.\n",
      "   - Use `dim_orders` to get order status for cancellation rate.\n",
      "   - Group by single-item vs multi-item.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Visualization:**\n",
      "   - Bar chart comparing the three metrics for both groups.\n",

      "- Top performers in revenue growth are in 'Sports & Leisure', 'Pets', and 'Cool Stuff' categories, with revenue growth above 500%.\n",
      "- Highest AOVs are seen in 'Musical Instruments' and 'Computers' categories, indicating high-value transactions.\n",

      "Recommendations:\n",
      "- Focus on supporting sellers with high revenue growth for further expansion.\n",
      "- Investigate what drives high AOV in 'Musical Instruments' and 'Computers' and replicate best practices in other categories.\n",
